<h1 align="center"> TSP-Tunisia: Solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem for Tunisia </h1>
 
The objective of the TSP-Tunisia project was to apply Graph Theory concepts to determine the most efficient way to traverse through all 24 states in Tunisia while covering the shortest possible distance. The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) served as the foundation for modeling this problem, aiming to find the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

The primary goal was to calculate an optimal route that minimizes travel distance, ensuring that every city is visited without repetition. To achieve this, Tunisian states were represented as nodes and the distances between was represented as edges, creating a weighted graph. The TSP algorithm was then utilized to compute the shortest path that covers all cities.

In this project, the longest distance between two consecutive cities was calculated to serve as a benchmark to establish a minimum distance that should be traveled each day. It illustrated that by adhering to a minimum daily distance of 321 km, the entire journey could be completed in 7 days. The total distance covered in this scenario was calculated to be 2080 km, optimizing the travel route for efficiency while visiting each city precisely once.
